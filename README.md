# Mission-On-Mars-Robotics-Challenge-2016-1-UNINORTE
Source codes for the MMRC'16 that took place in UNINORTE-Manaus in Jun/16. This project tries to replicate the Mathwork Competition in France that happen every year, using a prototype robot with Raspberry Pi and Arduino Due. In this case, we use a Raspberry with OpenCV and any Arduino with a capable Serial Comm.
